# Mood Tracker
This project is a mood tracking application that includes a login feature, utilizes an SQL database to store mood entries, and allows querying past mood data.
Please note that this is still a very early version, and many pages are incomplete or under development. Iâ€™m working on it gradually as a hobby, improving both the front-end and back-end when time allows.
